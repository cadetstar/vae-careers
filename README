== Editing of Information

With the new revision of the Careers website, much of the potentially dynamic information has been centralized in one of only a few places.

1. Most individual messages is located in config/locales/en.yml
2. The welcome email is found in app/views/general_mailer/welcome_email.html.erb
3. Most code-centric items are found in lib/vae.rb (such as the question types, etc...)
4. States, Provinces and Countries are in lib/states.yaml
