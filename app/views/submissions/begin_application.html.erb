It requires federal government contractors to ensure that applicants are selected for employment and are treated during employment without regard to their race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), or national origin.<br /><br />

        In addition, VAE is also subject to the Vietnam Era Veterans’ Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 and its subsequent amendments (Jobs for Veterans Act of 2000). It requires federal government contractors to take affirmative action to employ covered veterans and advance their employment.<br /><br />
